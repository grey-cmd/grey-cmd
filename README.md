## Hello, I'm Grey

I specialize in taking on impossible, soul-crushing projects that seem doomed from the start.
I tell myself I enjoy it, but often find myself facing tasks that would drive a lesser person to despair.
These projects test my sanity, and I have no hope of completing them.

Some of these projects include:
- A programming language    [Oxygen](https://github.com/grey-cmd/Oxygen)
- A game/creation engine    [Nimbus](https://github.com/grey-cmd/Nimbus)
- My own rendering API      [Volt](https://github.com/grey-cmd/Volt)
- My own operating system   [Cloud]
