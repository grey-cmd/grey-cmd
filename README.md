## Hello, I'm Grey

I specialize in taking on impossible, soul-crushing projects that seem doomed from the start.
I tell myself I enjoy it, but often find myself facing tasks that would drive a lesser person to despair.
These projects test my sanity, and I have no hope of completing them.

Some of these projects include:
- [Oxygen](https://github.com/grey-cmd/Oxygen): A programming language
- [Nimbus](https://github.com/grey-cmd/Nimbus): A creation engine
- [Volt](https://github.com/grey-cmd/Volt): My own rendering API/engine
- [Cloud]: My own operating system
